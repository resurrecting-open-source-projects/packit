.SH DESCRIPTION
Packit is a network auditing tool. It's value is derived from its ability to
customize, \fIinject\fP, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic. By allowing you to
define (spoof) all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP and Ethernet header options,
Packit can be useful to test firewalls, intrusion detection systems, port
scanning, simulating network traffic and general TCP/IP auditing. Packit is
also an excellent tool for learning TCP/IP.
.SH PACKIT BASE OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP mode
Select a runtime mode. Currently supported modes
are \fIcapture\fP, \fIinject\fP and trace. The default mode is \fIinject\fP.
.SH PACKET CAPTURE OPTIONS
\fBPacket\fP \fIcapture\fP options are as follows:
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fP count
Specify the number of packets to \fIcapture\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-e\fP
Display link-layer header data.
.TP
.B
\fB-G\fP
Display the timestamp in GMT rather than localtime.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP
Listen on \fIinterface\fP. If unspecified, \fBpackit\fP will use the lowest numbered
device in the 'up' state (excluding loopback).
.TP
.B
\fB-n\fP
Do not resolve host addresses to names but resolve ports numbers.
Disables DNS lookups.
.TP
.B
\fB-nn\fP
Do not resolve ports numbers to their \fIprotocol\fP names but resolve host
addresses.
.TP
.B
\fB-nnn\fP
Do not resolve host addresses or port numbers.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP \fIfile\fP
Read packet data from tcpdump formatted binary log \fIfile\fP. Example: a \fIfile\fP
created with \fB-w\fP option.
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP snaplen

.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Enables verbose packet \fIcapture\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-w\fP \fIfile\fP
Write the raw packets to \fIfile\fP rather than displaying time to stderr.
.TP
.B
\fB-X\fP
Display hexadecimal & ascii dump of each packet up to snap length bytes.
.TP
.B
\fIexpression\fP
Selects which packets should be displayed. If no \fIexpression\fP is
given, all packets are displayed. This option is based in pcap
library. See the \fBpcap-filter\fP(7) manpage for more detailed information.
.SH PACKET INJECTION AND TRACE
\fBPacket\fP injection is used to define and \fIinject\fP a network traffic onto
your network. You have the ability to define essentially any ARP, IP, TCP,
UDP, ICMP and Ethernet header value. This can be valuable in a number of ways,
including testing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, simulating traffic
flow and general TCP/IP auditing.
.SH CHOOSE A PROTOCOL
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP \fIprotocol\fP
Specify the type of packet to \fIinject\fP. Supported values are: ARP,
RARP, TCP, UDP and ICMP. This option defaults to TCP in \fIinject\fP
mode and to ICMP in trace mode.
.SH PACKET INJECTION AND TRACE GENERAL
This section documents the operational command-line options.
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fP count
The value of count is the total number of packets we would like to
\fIinject\fP (a count value of 0 means forever).
.TP
.B
\fB-b\fP burst rate
Specifies the number of packets to \fIinject\fP every interval (defined
by \fB-w\fP). A burst rate of 0 will send packets as quickly as possible.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP
Host response mode. Enabling this option will print any packet you
\fIinject\fP and then wait to see if the remote host responds. See \fB-H\fP
option for timeout.
.TP
.B
\fB-H\fP timeout
Specify the timeout value (in seconds) to use with '\fB-h\fP'. This value
defaults to '1' second.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP \fIinterface\fP
Specify the \fIinterface\fP to transmit from, if the machine has multiple
interfaces.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP
Verbose injection mode. Displays each packet you \fIinject\fP. It also has
the same effect as in \fIcapture\fP mode while used with the '\fB-h\fP' option.
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP payload
This option defines the payload portion of the header. Hex payload
should be prefixed with '0x' with each value separated by a
whitespace. An ASCII example: \fB-p\fP 'hello, this is my packet'. A Hex
example: \fB-p\fP '0x 70 61 63 6B 69 74'.
.TP
.B
\fB-w\fP interval
Specify the number of seconds to wait between packet bursts. This
value defaults to '1' second.
.TP
.B
\fB-Z\fP length
Specify the size of the \fBpacket\fP(s) to \fIinject\fP. The maximum value
is 65535.
.SH IP HEADER OPTIONS
This section documents the IP header command-line options.
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP src address

\fBpackit\fP will default to the IP address of the lowest numbered device
in the 'up' state, excluding loopback.
.TP
.B
\fB-sR\fP
Use a random source IP address.
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP dst address
The IP address of the machine you would like to contact.
.TP
.B
\fB-dR\fP
Use a random destination IP address.
.TP

TOS values are typically in hexadecimal format, however, \fBpackit\fP only
accepts TOS values as integers. Below are the 4 valid TOS bit values:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
Minimize delay: 16 (0x10)
.IP \(bu 3
Maximize throughput: 8 (0x08)
.IP \(bu 3

.PP
As an example, to set the SYN and FIN bits use the following: \fB-F\fP SF
.RE
.TP
.B
\fB-q\fP sequence number
The sequence number is a 32-bit unsigned (positive) number used to
identify the byte in a stream of data from the sending TCP to the
receiving TCP that the first byte of data represents.

.B
\fB-eR\fP
Use a random source Ethernet address. If you define this, you will most
likely need to define the destination Ethernet header value as well. When
using either \fB-e\fP or \fB-E\fP, you enable link level packet injection and the
destination cannot be auto-defined while injecting in this manner.
.TP

The Ethernet (hardware) of the next routable \fIinterface\fP which the packet
will cross while making it's way to the destination.

be followed if you actually want the destination to receive the packets
you're sending:
.RS
.IP 1. 4
If the destination exists beyond your default route (gateway),
the destination Ethernet address should be set to the default
routes Ethernet address. This can typically be found by using
the \fBarp\fP(8) command.
.IP 2. 4
If the destination exists on your subnet, the destination
Ethernet address should be set to its Ethernet address. This
can typically be found by using the \fBarp\fP(8) command.
